Installing Rgraphviz
====================

Windows
=======

Feb 5, 2008

Here are the steps to build Rgraphviz on Windows:

o. make sure your MSVCR80.DLL is from Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 
   Redistributable Package 
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&displaylang=en

o. install graphviz ***2.16*** Windows ***binary*** distribution from
      http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
   , say, in dir $DIR.  We use the following as an example:
         C:\R-tools\graphviz-2.16
   .  If you install it in other dir, just use your dir correspondingly.

o. set the following Windows environment variables accordingly
   (control panel -> systems -> Advanced -> Environment Variables ):
   (a) create new user variables:
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_DIR   (e.g., C:\/R-tools\/graphviz-2.16)
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_MAJOR (e.g., 2)
     GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_MINOR (e.g., 16)

     Notice the way "\/" are used for the paths above.

   (b) add to user variable 'path': $GRAPHVIZ_INSTALL_DIR/bin
     e.g., C:\R-tools\graphviz-2.16\bin

o. run "R CMD INSTALL ...Rgraphviz" as usual

o. to be safe when running R, do the following in THE FOLLOWING order:
    > ## ...make sure NO library("graph") is loaded...
    > dyn.load("c:/R-tools/graphviz-2.16/bin/gvc.dll")
    > library("Rgraphviz")
    > ## ...operate as normal...
   This explicit loading of graphviz-2.16/bin/gvc.dll is a workaround
   for resolving libs name conflicts with the graph package. Code has
   been added to Rgraphviz's .onLoad function to resolve these libs
   name conflicts with the graph package, but this code is considered
   to be experimental.

Source based installation
=========================

The Rgraphviz package depends on the Graphviz library which can be
obtained from http://www.graphviz.org/.

At present, Rgraphviz is known to work with Graphviz versions greater
than or equal to 2.2 (note however that a bug in the neato layout
routine makes it preferable not to use versions 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8)

To install Graphviz:

 1. Download the source tarball from http://www.graphviz.org/
 2. Unpack the distribution (tar -xzvf)
 3. Read the Graphviz installation instructions.  Basically, you
    should be able to do:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

A word of warning, especially on the Mac OS X platform: Rgraphviz may
not work if Graphviz is compiled with optimization.

For the most recent version of Graphviz, you will also need to make
sure that pkg-config (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/) is
installed on your system.  If you install Graphviz to a non-standard
location, you may need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
to tell pkg-config where the Graphviz metadata lives.  Here is an example:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/graphviz/lib/pkgconfig

At this point you should be able to install Rgraphviz either via R CMD
INSTALL or by starting R and using install.packages.

Note that older versions of Graphviz use a configure script called
dotneato-config which must be in your PATH for Rgraphviz to find it.
This is instead of the pkg-config setup.
